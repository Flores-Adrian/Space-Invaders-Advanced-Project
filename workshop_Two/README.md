The reason there are multiples folders in the workshop_Two folder is because each folder has a seperate section from workshop 2.
The reason I made them like this is for the people that weren't able to fully copy the code and wanted to see how each part of the code works.

The actual final code of the workshop two is in the "finalCode" folder! That is where we should have left off in the workshop 2!
