# Workshop 2 Folder

The reason there are multiples folders in the workshop_Two folder is because each folder has a seperate section from workshop 2. I made them the folders like this for the people that weren't able to fully copy the code and want to see how each part of the code works and be able to copy the code for demonstration.

In the Images folder, it should contain the images we are going to import onto our code. Make sure the folder is inside your actual project folder!

The actual final code of workshop 2 is in the "finalCode" folder! That is where we should have left off in the workshop 2.
