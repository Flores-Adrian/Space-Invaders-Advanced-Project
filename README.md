# Space-Invaders-Advanced-Project
Hello guys, this is our GitHub repository to view our code for the Space Invaders game!

I created different folders for each section of the workshops just in case any one of you guys got stuck on a certain section. The reason I created them like that is so you guys can test out how each object(laser, obstacle, etc.) works individually but feel free to look through the folders! In each workshop folder there should be a folder called "finalCode" which will the contain the final code we left off on for that specific workshop.

I plan on creating a folder that contains the actual final code in the future.
